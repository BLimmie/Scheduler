This platform allows admin users to create courses and majors, and allows admins to specify various major requirements.

For student users, this platform serves to give the ability to add the courses to a grid interface and verify a schedule of courses based on their major and prior coursework.

*User account creation is possible. Nonetheless, the following credentials can be used to access a default student account or a default admin account:*

* *_Email:_* **john.doe@gmail.com**
* *_Password:_* **password**

Potential Issues:
* Database functionality may be questionable.
* Some calls to the verify function may be inaccurate due to latency issues.
* Editing user profiles is not a function that is available yet.
* The list of courses on the left side of the webpage has limited functionality.


***Good luck, Commander.***
