**By Christopher Alsheikh, Xia Hedi, Brian Lim, Justin Nilsen, and Ty Still**  

This project is supposed to inform students if their 4 year schedule, based on units already taken, is valid.  
It will allow students a better idea of what classes they will take when, and possibly advise them on if a class is likely to be held in a given quarter.  

To compile the java files, just type "make".  To clean the src folder and get rid of the .class files, type "make clean".

To run the program, run the static void main function in Driver by typing "java Driver".  The Command-Line interface should then run and you're good to go.

One thing to note: there are no pre-loaded Users in the program, so on the first execution of the program you won't be able to sign into any existing User.

***Good luck, Commander.***
